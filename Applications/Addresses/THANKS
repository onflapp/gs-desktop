Many people on #gnustep, especially Riccardo Mottola and Nicolas
Roard, helped me locate and fix many bugs. Thanks very much for that.

Many thanks also goes to Andreas Heppel, Frederic Praca, Peter Cooper
and Riccardo again for helping with making Addresses compile on
pre-C99 compilers.

Rob Burns and Alex Malmberg cleared up a couple of encoding issues
that are still hard to grasp for me.

Calvin Mitchell provided me with a very non-standard VCF file which
helped making VCF importing more robust.

Guenther Noack for VCF Hex handling code
